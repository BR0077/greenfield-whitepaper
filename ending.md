# Ending

Greenfield is a giant economy and ecosystem. There are still important
components missing from the current versions, e.g. the execution
environment for the stored object to run. There are also features and
interfaces not explained clearly in all the details. So the real ending
hasn't come as this paper will be revised as time goes on.

Although Greenfield, especially with its handy infrastructure, efficient
performance, convenient APIs, and strong cross-chain integration with a
large DeFi system and compatibility, provides possibilities for new
models of Web3, its success largely depends on the application layer
innovations from the developers and community. The openness of
Greenfield should be ensured on different levels of the systems and
management.

Hope everyone enjoys this journey!
